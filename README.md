# Maintenance Scheduling

 
The project was initially setup with a build file using quarkus.
For this go to the link https://code.quarkus.io

Using quarkus we are going to use the extension "Rest Easy" to expose the REST service.

OptaPlanner is used to generate the optimal maintenance schedule.

Hibernate is used to store the data into a relational database.
